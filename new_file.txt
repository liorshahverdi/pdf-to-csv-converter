These include sovereign states, dependencies, \n\noverseas departments, and some territories whose status \n\nor boundaries may be undetermined or in dispute. \nMore \n\ndeveloped\n regions, following the UN classi\u02dacation, \ncomprise all of Europe and North America, plus Australia, \n\nJapan, and New Zealand. All other regions and countries \n\nare classi\u02daed as \nless developed\n. The \nleast developed\n countries consist of 48 countries with especially low \n\nincomes, high economic vulnerability, and poor human \n\ndevelopment indicators; 34 of these countries are in sub-\n\nSaharan Africa, 13 in Asia, and one in the Caribbean. \n\nThe criteria and list of countries, as de\u02daned by the United \n\nNations, can be found at http://unohrlls.org/about-ldcs/.\nSub-Saharan Africa: \nAll countries of Africa except \nthe northern African countries of Algeria, Egypt, Libya, \n\nMorocco, Sudan, Tunisia, and Western Sahara. \nWorld \n\nand Regional Totals: \nRegional population totals are \n\nindependently rounded and include small countries or areas \n\nnot shown. Regional and world rates and percentages are \n\nweighted averages of countries for which data are available; \n\nregional averages are shown when data or estimates are \n\navailable for at least three-quarters of the region\u2122s population.\nWorld Population Data Sheets from different years \nshould \nnot be used as a time series\n. Fluctuations in values from \nyear to year often re\u02dcect revisions based on new data or \n\nestimates rather than actual changes in levels. Additional \n\ninformation on likely trends and consistent time series can \n\nbe obtained from PRB, and are also available from UN and \n\nU.S. Census Bureau publications and websites.\nSOURCES\n\nThe rates and \u02dagures, including those from 1970, are \n\nprimarily compiled from the following sources: of\u02dacial country \n\nstatistical yearbooks, bulletins, and websites; the United \n\nNations \nDemographic Yearbook, 2012\n, and \nPopulation and \nVital Statistics Report\n of the UN Statistics Division; \nWorld \nPopulation Prospects: The 2012 Revision\n of the UN Population \n\nDivision; and the International Data Base of the International \n\nPrograms Center, U.S. Census Bureau. Other sources include \n\nrecent demographic surveys such as the Demographic \n\nand Health Surveys, Reproductive Health Surveys, special \n\nstudies, and direct communication with demographers and \n\nstatistical bureaus in the United States and abroad. Speci\u02dac \n\ndata sources may be obtained by contacting the authors of \n\nthe \n2014 World Population Data Sheet\n. For countries with \ncomplete registration of births and deaths, rates are those \n\nmost recently reported. For more developed countries, nearly \n\nall vital rates refer to 2013 or 2012.\nDEFINITIONS\nMid-2014 Population\nEstimates are based on a recent census, of\u02dacial national \ndata, or PRB, UN, and U.S. Census Bureau projections.  \n\nThe effects of refugee movements, large numbers of foreign \n\nworkers, and population shifts due to contemporary political \n\nevents are taken into account to the extent possible.\nBirth and Death Rate\nThe annual number of births and deaths per 1,000 total \n\npopulation. These rates are often referred to as \ufb01crude \n\nrates\ufb02 since they do not take a population\u2122s age structure \n\ninto account. Thus, crude death rates in more developed \n\ncountries with a relatively large proportion of high-mortality \n\nolder population are often higher than those in less \n\ndeveloped countries with lower life expectancy.\nRate of Natural Increase (RNI)\nThe birth rate minus the death rate, implying the annual \n\nrate of population growth without regard for migration. \n\nExpressed as a percentage.\nNet Migration\nThe estimated rate of net immigration (immigration minus \n\nemigration) per 1,000 population for a recent year based \n\nupon the of\u02dacial national rate or derived as a residual \n\nfrom estimated birth, death, and population growth rates. \n\nMigration rates can vary substantially from year to year \n\nfor any particular country, as can the de\u02danition of an \n\nimmigrant.\nProjected Population, 2030-2050\nProjected populations based upon reasonable assumptions \n\non the future course of fertility, mortality, and migration. \nProjections are based upon of\u02dacial country projections, \n\nseries issued by the UN or the U.S. Census Bureau, or  \n\nPRB projections.\nInfant Mortality Rate, 1970 & 2013  \n(or most recent year for which data are available)\n The annual number of deaths of infants under age 1 per \n\n1,000 live births. Rates shown with decimals indicate \n\nnational statistics reported as completely registered, while \n\nthose without are estimates from the sources cited above. \n\nRates shown in italics are based upon fewer than 50 annual \n\ninfant deaths and, as a result, are subject to considerable \n\nyearly variability; rates shown for such countries are \n\naverages for a multiple-year period. \nTotal Fertility Rate (TFR), 1970 & 2013  \n(or most recent year for which data are available)\nThe average number of children a woman would have \n\nassuming that current age-speci\u02dac birth rates remain \n\nconstant throughout her childbearing years (usually \n\nconsidered to be ages 15 to 49).\nPopulation Under Age 15/Age 65+\nThe percentage of the total population in those ages,  \n\nwhich are often considered the \ufb01dependent ages.\ufb02 \nLife Expectancy at Birth, 1970 & 2013  \n(or most recent year for which data are available)\nThe average number of years a newborn infant can  \n\nexpect to live under current mortality levels. \nPercent Urban\nPercentage of the total population living in areas termed \n\n\ufb01urban\ufb02 by that country or by the UN. Countries de\u02dane \n\nurban in many different ways, from population centers \n\nof 100 or more dwellings to only the population living in \n\nnational and provincial capitals.\nContraceptive Use\nThe percentage of currently married or \ufb01in union\ufb02 women \n\nof reproductive age who are currently using any form of \n\ncontraception. \ufb01Modern\ufb02 methods include clinic and supply \n\nmethods such as the pill, IUD, condom, and sterilization. \n\nData are from the most recently available national-level \n\nsurveys, such as Demographic and Health Surveys, \n\nReproductive Health Surveys, Multiple Indicator Cluster \n\nSurveys, regional survey programs, national surveys, and \n\nthe UN Population Division \nWorld Contraceptive Use 2014\n. For more developed countries, data refer to some point \n\nin the 1990s and early 2000s. Data for less developed \n\ncountries are primarily from a point in the mid-2000s to a \n\nvery recent year. Data prior to 2008 are shown in italics.\nGNI PPP per Capita, 2013 (US$)\nGNI PPP per capita is gross national income in purchasing \n\npower parity (PPP) divided by mid-year population. GNI PPP \n\nrefers to gross national income converted to \ufb01international\ufb02 \n\ndollars using a purchasing power parity conversion factor. \n\nInternational dollars indicate the amount of goods and \n\nservices one could buy in the United States with a given \n\namount of money. Data are from the World Bank. Figures in \n\nitalics are for 2009-2012.\nCarbon Emissions, 1990 & 2012  \nFossil fuel and cement production emissions by country. \n\nThe world emissions include bunker fuels, or emissions \n\nfrom fuels used for international aviation and maritime \n\ntransport. All values are in million tons per year. The 1990 \n\nemissions are based on UN reporting and U.S. Geological \n\nService. The 2012 emissions are preliminary and based on \n\nBP statistics and U.S. Geological Survey cement data. Data \n\nare from T.A. Boden, G. Marland, and R.J.
